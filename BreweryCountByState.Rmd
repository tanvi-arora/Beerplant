## Brewery Count by US State

As part of evaluating geographic locations, Halv de Maan needs to know at a minimum how many U.S. breweries there are by state. 
...Include graphics here..
...Add data summarize by region ..  west, central, south, northeast
...??  what are the findings based on this part??

```{r echo=TRUE}
#a. Bring Breweries.txt into R   
USbrews <- read.csv("breweries.csv", header = TRUE)          #Read in the breweries datafile
dim(USbrews)                                               #confirm all data lines were read in

#b. Retrieve the last ten rows of the USbrews dataframe
tail(USbrews, 10)

#c.
#Verify that there are no NAs in each dataset before running analysis
sum(is.na(USbrews$Brew_ID))
sum(is.na(USbrews$Name))
sum(is.na(USbrews$City))
sum(is.na(USbrews$State))


# Count by State
USbrewsByState <- table(USbrews$State)
USbrewsByState
dim(USbrewsByState)

#barchart
par(las=2)
barplot(USbrewsByState, main = "Brewery Count by US State- THIS IS TOO HARD TO READ", xlab="Count", ylab="State", col="lightseagreen", horiz=TRUE)

# this needs to be run on the MERGED Beer and Brewery dataset
#The top 10 states with the most number of breweries 
#SortDescByCount <- MergedData[order(-MergedData$Total),]   
#SortDescByCount[1:10, "State",] 


#Add Region column to the dataframe
USbrews$Region<-NA

#USbrews$Region[USbrews$State == 'MA'] <- "NE"  

NorthEastVector <- c("ME","NH","VT","MA", "CT", "RI","NY","NJ", "PA", "DE")
SouthVector <- c("MD","DC", "VA","NC","SC","GA","FL","TN","KY","AL","MS","LA","AR")
CentralVector <- c("TX","OK","KS","")
WestVector <- c("CA","WA")

USbrews$Region [is.element(USbrews$State, NorthEastVector)]  <- "NE" 

#Generate graphs by regions.. 

```
